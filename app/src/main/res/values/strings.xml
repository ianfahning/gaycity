    <string name="Intersectionality_description">We recognize that our community members are multifaceted, with overlapping and intersecting identities.

We are committed to honoring those truths in all that we do.</string>

    <string name="transparancy_description">Gay City sees transparency being key in creating equitable outcomes and getting people what they need to be successful. We have established policies, procedures, and practices with the intent to be clear and open with the communities we serve.</string>
    <string name="our_history">Our History</string>
    <string name="history_description">2020 marks Gay City’s 25th year of building resilience and joy in LGBTQ communities. \nIn 1995, a group of community activists launched Gay City with a bold vision of building a community stronger than HIV while centering queer voices. This mission evolved in the 2000s when the organization introduced its Wellness Center, Arts Programs, and established a physical space where all LGBTQ people could be themselves. \nToday, Gay City remains the leading HIV/STI tester in King County, home to several LGBTQ&#8211;affirming services, and provides access to hundreds of resources. The organization is also an active force in queer youth engagement and provides LGBTQ&#8211;centered trainings that address the needs of the most marginalized people within our community.</string>
